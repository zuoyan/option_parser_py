# option_parser, a command line argv parsing module

## WHY another

Yes, it's another wheel, with some/little differences.

It follows the same design as a internal used C++ library, so i can
avoid to be confused by argparse, esp. with the reordering. In
option_parser, an option is just splited as (match, process,
document). Match is first called, the process correspending to the
highest match result is called and return the next start index.

First, option_parser is simple than argparse. I don't need to
implement any strange options(like 'ps -aux').

Second, option_parser is a little more consensus than argparse. Any
match/action can be implemented by self define functions.

Third, reordering is disabled at default.

## Example
